heatmap(xs, ys, zs, colormap = Reverse(:deep))


"
The best way forwards I think is to make a Pull Request at InteractiveDynamics.jl 
that allows this heatmap out of the box. Makie.jl supports a heatmap with arbitrary 
coordinates. So first one makes the coordinates, nbinx, nbiny = size(property). 
Then coordx = range(0, 1; length = nbinx) and same for y. 
Then, heatmap!(ax, coordx, coordy, property; ...) . Shouldn't be too hard. 
Have a go and if not possible for you I'll do it.
