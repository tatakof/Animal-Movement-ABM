    model_step!(model::ABM)

The `model_step!` function is responsible for updating the grass states in the model. It iterates through all positions in the model and performs the following steps:

1. If the grass at position `p` is not fully grown:
    - If the countdown at position `p` is less than or equal to 0, set the grass to fully grown and reset the countdown to the model's `regrowth_time`.
    - Otherwise, decrement the countdown at position `p` by 1.

# Arguments
- `model::ABM`: An instance of the agent-based model.
